Metric Center: Consider we have a set of points in 2-D space. If we pick a point (x,y) and draw a circle with (x,y) as the center such that
the circle barely encloses all the points in the set. If we draw such a "all points enclosing circle" using each point as center in the set then
the point with enclosing circle having smallest area is the metric center.
